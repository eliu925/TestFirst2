### Test-First-Part-2

TestFirst JavaScript is a multi-part series that provides practice to intermediate to advanced javascript concepts. The majority of concepts introduced in TestFirst have mini lessons and practice exercises in the workshops on learndot. However, there will be new concepts introduced in TestFirst that you will need to learn on your own by reading documentation (it's important to begin learning how to read documentation efficiently!)

- 06: functions-and-closure
- 07: functional-programming
  - recreate-array-methods
  - use-array-methods
- 08: classes
  - 00-refactor-RPN-Calculator
  - 01-classes
  - 02-macbooks

### Before beginning your assignment, make sure you have completed these steps: 

1. Forked & cloned the TestFirst repository.
2. Installed node and a text editor.


### Setup Test First

- **[Fork the repository to your personal GitHub Account](https://github.com/fullstackacademy/TestFirst-Part-1/)**
- Clone the repository to your local machine
- Install `testem` with the `npm install` command
- Run `testem` with the `npm test` command.


### Run Testem with npm test

In your TestFirst directory run the command:

```sh
$ npm install
```

After the installation is completed, run the command:

```sh
$ npm test
```

The `npm test` command will run the local installation of `testem`! If you installed `testem` locally with this approach, instead of running `testem` run `npm test` whenever you want to launch `testem`. In addition, whenever clone a new TestFirst repository to your local machine (such as TestFirst-Part-2 or Checkpoints), you need to run `npm install` first, afterwards you can run `npm test`.

Here is a [video demonstrating](https://youtu.be/KdMu351vFKw) the `npm test` command.
